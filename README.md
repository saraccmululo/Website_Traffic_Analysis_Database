Project name: Website Traffic Analysis Database

Scope
The purpose of my database is to store and analyze website traffic data. 
Websites often collect information about their visitors, such as the pages they visited, and the actions they take while browsing. 
This kind of data helps website owners understand which pages are most popular, how users navigate their site, 
and which actions are most commonly performed. 
I designed this database to store this type of activity and to help analyze user behavior.
